# ML Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how these algorithms work internally, without relying on any external libraries for the core logic. The implemented algorithms include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each algorithm is implemented in Python with detailed comments and explanations to help you understand the underlying principles and mathematics.
